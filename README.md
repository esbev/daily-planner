## Special Thanks

Thanks goes out to all the instructors and teacher assistants for their clear instruction and prompt and thorough answers to all my questions. Also, to all the students who joined in the study groups for their active participation and alternative perspectives. I was able to gain multiple insights I otherwise may not have gained towards the project without them. There is always strength in numbers.
