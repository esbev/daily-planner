# Module 5 Challenge - Daily Planner 

## Description

The daily planner website was built to give a user an easy and convenient way to plan out their workday by the hour from 9AM to 5PM. The site will actively show the current date posted at the top of the page. Each hour given has a textbox for the user to enter what they want to accomplish during that block of time and a save button. Once the user has entered their text they can then use the save button to save the text for the next time they visit the page. If the user wants to change the text in any time block they will simply click in the box, change the text, and hit the save button again. The information in each block will always store the text in the box from the most recent click of the save button. The website has color-coded text boxes to indicate to the user which hour blocks are in the past, in the future, and which hour block is in the current hour. These indicators update automatically for the user with no input or action needed. The code itself builds the list of hours, text boxes, and save buttons for the website all within the script.js file.

## Special Thanks

    Thanks goes out to all the instructors and teacher assistants for their clear instruction and prompt and thorough answers to all my questions. Also, to all the students who joined in the study groups for their active participation and alternative perspectives. I was able to gain multiple insights I otherwise may not have gained towards the project without them. There is always strength in numbers.
